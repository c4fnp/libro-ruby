{"name":"ruby_rbenv","version":"2.1.1","description":"Manages rbenv and installs Rbenv based Rubies","long_description":"# Chef ruby_rbenv Cookbook\n\n[![CircleCI Status](https://circleci.com/gh/sous-chefs/ruby_rbenv/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/sous-chefs/ruby_rbenv/tree/master)\n[![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/ruby_rbenv.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/ruby_rbenv)\n\n## Description\n\nManages [rbenv][rbenv_site] and its installed Rubies.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Chef\n\nThis cookbook requires Chef 13.0+.\n\n### Platform\n\n- Debian derivatives\n- Fedora\n- macOS (not currently tested)\n- RHEL derivatives (RHEL, CentOS, Amazon Linux, Oracle, Scientific Linux)\n- openSUSE and openSUSE leap\n\n# Usage\n\n**Please read**\n\nExample installations are provided in `test/fixtures/cookbooks/test/recipes/`.\n\nA `rbenv_system_install` or `rbenv_user_install` is required to be set so that rbenv knows which version you want to use, and is installed on the system.\n\nSystem wide installations of rbenv are supported by this cookbook, but discouraged by the rbenv maintainer, see [these][rbenv_issue_38] [two][rbenv_issue_306] issues in the rbenv repository.\n\n## Gem\n\nUsed to install a gem into the selected rbenv environment.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_gem 'gem_name' do\n  options # Optional: Options to pass to the gem command e.g. '--no-rdoc --no-ri'\n  source # Optional: source URL/location for gem.\n  timeout # Optional: Gem install timeout\n  version # Optional: Gem version to install\n  response_file # Optional: response file to reconfigure a gem\n  rbenv_version # Required: Which rbenv version to install the gem to.\n  user # Which user to install gem to. REQUIRED if you're using rbenv_user_install\nend\n```\n\n## Global\n\nSets the global ruby version. The name of the resource is the version to set.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_global '2.5.1' do\n  user # Optional: if passed sets the users global version. Leave unset, to set the system global version\nend\n```\n\nIf a user is passed in to this resource it sets the global version for the user, under the users `root_path` (usually `~/.rbenv/version`), otherwise it sets the system global version.\n\n## Plugin\n\nInstalls a rbenv plugin.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_plugin 'ruby-build' do\n  git_url # Git URL of the plugin\n  git_ref # Git reference of the plugin\n  user # Optional: if passed installs to the users rbenv. Do not set, to set installs to the system rbenv.\nend\n```\n\nIf user is passed in, the plugin is installed to the users install of rbenv.\n\n## Rehash\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_rehash 'rehash' do\n  user 'vagrant' # Optional: if passed rehashes the user Ruby otherwise rehashes the system rbenv\nend\n```\n\nIf user is passed in, the user Ruby is rehashed rather than the system Ruby.\n\n## Ruby\n\nInstalls a given Ruby version to the system or user location.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_ruby '2.5.1' do\n  user # Optional, but recommended: If passed, the user to install rbenv to\n  rbenv_action # Optional: the action to perform, 'install' (default), 'uninstall' etc\nend\n```\n\nShorter example `rbenv_ruby '2.5.1'`\n\n## Script\n\nRuns a rbenv aware script.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_script 'foo' do\n  rbenv_version #rbenv version to run the script against\n  environment # Optional: A Hash of environment variables in the form of ({\"ENV_VARIABLE\" => \"VALUE\"}).\n  user # Optional: User to run as\n  group # Optional: Group to run as\n  returns # Optional: Expected return code\n  code # Script code to run\nend\n```\nNote that environment overwrites the entire variable.\nFor example. setting the `$PATH` variable can be done like this:\n```ruby\nrbenv_script 'bundle package' do\n  cwd node[\"bundle_dir\"]\n  environment ({\"PATH\" => \"/usr/local/rbenv/shims:/usr/local/rbenv/bin:#{ENV[\"PATH\"]}\"})\n  code \"bundle package --all\"\nend\n```\nWhere `#{ENV[\"PATH\"]}` appends the existing PATH to the end of the newly set PATH.\n\n\n## System_install\n\nInstalls rbenv to the system location, by default `/usr/local/rbenv`\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_system_install 'foo' do\n  git_url # URL of the plugin repo you want to checkout\n  git_ref # Optional: Git reference to checkout\n  update_rbenv # Optional: Keeps the git repo up to date\nend\n```\n\n## User_install\n\nInstalls rbenv to the user path, making rbenv available to that user only.\n\n```ruby\nrbenv_user_install 'vagrant' do\n  git_url # Optional: Git URL to checkout rbenv from.\n  git_ref # Optional: Git reference to checkout e.g. 'master'\n  user # Which user to install rbenv to (also specified in the resources name above)\nend\n```\n\n## System-Wide macOS Installation Note\n\nThis cookbook takes advantage of managing profile fragments in an `/etc/profile.d` directory, common on most Unix-flavored platforms. Unfortunately, macOS does not support this idiom out of the box, so you may need to [modify][mac_profile_d] your user profile.\n\n## Development\n\n- Source hosted at [GitHub][repo]\n- Report issues/Questions/Feature requests on [GitHub Issues][issues]\n\nPull requests are very welcome!
